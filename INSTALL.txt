Building and Installing
========================
To build ProxyManager you need qt libraries and dev-tools.
On a Debian- or debian-derived distribution you can do:

   sudo apt-get qt4-dev-tools

which should pull what you need.

Then do, in the root of the project:

   qmake
   make
   sudo make install

This should build the daemon and the client and install them ind /usr/local/bin. Also, an init-script, 'proxy-manager', is copied to /etc/init.d.

If you want the daemon, proxymanagerd, to start automatically when booting your machine, you can (on Debian) run: 

  sudo update-rc.d proxy-manager defaults

I don't know how to install a service on ubuntu under upstart (or under systemd for that matter).


Setting up Squid
================

Proxy manager expects squid to be installed on your machine and running on port 3128.

Do:

   sudo apt-get install squid

(Note: Squid3 is not really usable, it has to be Squid 2.x)

Proxy manager maintains the file /var/run/proxymanagerd/squid.conf. You must add the following line:

include /var/run/proxymanagerd/squid.conf 

to /etc/squid/squid.conf.
